# Tasks: Liquid Democracy Engine

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-liquid-democracy-engine/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Smart Contracts**: `contracts/src/`, `contracts/test/`
- **Enclave Service**: `enclave-service/src/`, `enclave-service/tests/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`, `frontend/src/tests/`
- **E2E Tests**: `tests/e2e/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5)
- **Enclave Attestation (Phase 8)**: Can proceed in parallel with user stories 1-3, must complete before US5
- **Proposal System (Phase 9)**: Optional, depends on US1-2 completion
- **Polish (Phase 10)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses US1 delegation function but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after US1-3 have contract implementations (needs delegation data) - Independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Depends on Phase 8 (Enclave Attestation) completion - Independently testable once attestation works

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD)
- Smart contract interfaces and libraries before implementations
- Smart contracts before enclave service integration
- Smart contracts before frontend components
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks T002-T015 marked [P] can run in parallel

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Contract interfaces T017-T021 can run in parallel
- Contract libraries T022-T023 can run in parallel
- Enclave foundation T027-T028 can run in parallel with contract work
- Frontend foundation T031-T035 can run in parallel with backend work
- Scripts T037-T039 can run in parallel

**Within Each User Story**:
- All tests marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models/components in different files marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

**Phase 10 (Polish)**:
- Security analysis T183-T184 can run in parallel
- Documentation tasks T187-T189 and T202-T204 can run in parallel
- Performance tests T196-T200 can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (after writing them):
Task T040: "Unit test for DelegationManager.delegate()"
Task T041: "Unit test for transitive delegation"
Task T042: "Unit test for cycle detection"
Task T043: "Unit test for max depth validation"
Task T044: "Security test for reentrancy protection"
Task T045: "Integration test for end-to-end delegation"
Task T046: "Enclave service test for GraphComputer"
Task T047: "Frontend component test for TopicSelector"
Task T048: "Frontend component test for DelegateInput"
Task T049: "E2E test for delegation user journey"

# Launch parallel enclave and frontend work (after contracts done):
Task T057: "Implement EnclaveOperator main service"
Task T062: "Create TopicSelector component"
Task T063: "Create DelegateInput component"
Task T064: "Create DelegationList component"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T016)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T017-T039) - CRITICAL blocking phase
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T040-T068) - Delegation with transitive support
4. Complete Phase 8: Enclave Attestation (T150-T165) - Required for US1 voting power computation
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently with full attestation flow
6. Deploy minimal MVP to testnet (T190-T194)

### Incremental Delivery (Recommended)

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 + Enclave Attestation ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Deploy/Demo MVP!** (Core delegation working)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Revocation adds flexibility)
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Dead-end adds trust signaling)
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Transparency via visualization)
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (Economic sustainability)
7. Optionally add Proposal System (Phase 9) for full governance
8. Polish and Production Readiness (Phase 10)

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3+ developers after Foundational phase completes:

- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (Smart Contracts + Tests)
- **Developer B**: Enclave Service (Foundation + US1 integration)
- **Developer C**: Frontend (Foundation + US1 components)

Then continue with US2, US3, US4, US5 in parallel or sequentially based on priorities.

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 208
- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: 16 tasks
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 23 tasks - BLOCKS all user stories
- **Phase 3 (User Story 1 - P1)**: 29 tasks (10 tests + 19 implementation)
- **Phase 4 (User Story 2 - P2)**: 19 tasks (7 tests + 12 implementation)
- **Phase 5 (User Story 3 - P3)**: 18 tasks (6 tests + 12 implementation)
- **Phase 6 (User Story 4 - P4)**: 19 tasks (5 tests + 14 implementation)
- **Phase 7 (User Story 5 - P5)**: 25 tasks (6 tests + 19 implementation)
- **Phase 8 (Enclave Attestation)**: 16 tasks (5 tests + 11 implementation)
- **Phase 9 (Proposal System - Optional)**: 17 tasks (5 tests + 12 implementation)
- **Phase 10 (Polish)**: 26 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 87 tasks marked [P] can run in parallel within their phases

**Independent Test Criteria**:
- **US1**: Successfully delegate voting power with transitive support, verify power flows to final delegate
- **US2**: Revoke delegation, verify power returns, observe chain updates
- **US3**: Declare dead-end, attempt delegation (should fail), view status
- **US4**: View graph with 500 nodes in <5s, trace vote path, see power distribution
- **US5**: Accumulate power, see streaming rewards, observe adjustments on delegation changes

**MVP Scope**: Phases 1-3 + Phase 8 (Setup + Foundational + US1 + Enclave Attestation) = **68 tasks**

**Constitution Compliance**:
- ‚úÖ Test-First Development: Tests written before implementation for all phases
- ‚úÖ Library-First Architecture: Clear interfaces and modular components
- ‚úÖ Simplicity & YAGNI: MVP focused, proven patterns (OpenZeppelin, Superfluid)
- ‚úÖ Smart Contract Security: Security tests, reentrancy guards, access control
- ‚úÖ Observability: Events for all state changes, graph visualization, comprehensive logging

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Test-First**: ALL tests must be written FIRST and FAIL before implementation begins
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Phase 2 (Foundational) is CRITICAL - nothing else can proceed until complete
- Constitution requires no violations - all architecture decisions documented in research.md
- Target network: Gnosis Chiado testnet for MVP deployment
- Performance targets: <30s confirmation, <5s graph load, 1000 participants supported
