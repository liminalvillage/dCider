# RewardDistributor Deployment Summary

## Deployment Details

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Network**: Chiado Testnet (chainId: 10200)
**Contract**: RewardDistributorSimple
**Address**: `0x8a4f7A29989565F36216Eb82ca030bEb129E039A`

**Transaction**: 0xf32acd8ecdb5d70eed7f106cbf23b29633287d1beef934b79387227a09b0833b
**Gas Used**: 1,150,698

## Configuration

### Pool Flow Rates

Each topic has been configured with the following flow rate:
- **Flow Rate**: 0.00011574074074074 tokens/second
- **Daily Capacity**: ~10 tokens/day per topic
- **Topics Configured**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

**Total System Capacity**:
- 0.00069444444444444 tokens/second
- ~60 tokens/day across all topics

### Access Control

✅ **Roles Configured**:
- `VERIFIER_ROLE` granted to VotePowerVerifier (0x9aef5a8B434BF396049E06050e59D1036Eed7e84)
- `ADMIN_ROLE` granted to deployer (0xd5543e542B768B31a804961509dBf9D6eeE6eDBc)
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` granted to deployer

### Connected Contracts

- **VotePowerVerifier**: `0x9aef5a8B434BF396049E06050e59D1036Eed7e84`
- **DelegationManager**: `0x4c8875ac664bb0a94f5eE71b232A786772Fdd704`
- **TopicRegistry**: `0x9d9063f220aA191aAC406De2A5432A577b253827`

## Frontend Integration

The frontend has been updated with the deployed address:

**File**: `frontend/src/lib/contracts/addresses.ts`
```typescript
rewardDistributor: '0x8a4f7A29989565F36216Eb82ca030bEb129E039A'
```

## Manual Steps Required

⚠️ **Important**: The VotePowerVerifier contract needs to be connected to the RewardDistributor.

This requires calling `VotePowerVerifier.setRewardDistributor()` with ADMIN_ROLE:

```typescript
await VotePowerVerifier.setRewardDistributor("0x8a4f7A29989565F36216Eb82ca030bEb129E039A");
```

This step failed during deployment because the deploying account doesn't have ADMIN_ROLE on VotePowerVerifier. It should be completed by the contract owner.

## Verification

Run the verification script to check configuration:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-rewards.ts --network chiado
```

**Current Status**: ✅ All checks passed (3/3)
- VotePowerVerifier address correctly configured
- VERIFIER_ROLE granted
- ADMIN_ROLE granted
- All topic flow rates configured

## Testing

The RewardDistributor is now ready to use:

1. Navigate to the Rewards page in the frontend: `/rewards`
2. Select a topic from the dropdown
3. View pool information and active delegates
4. Check your own reward stream (if you have delegated voting power)

## Implementation Notes

### Why RewardDistributorSimple?

The simplified version was deployed instead of the full Superfluid implementation because:
1. Missing ERC777 dependencies in the Superfluid package
2. Simpler to deploy and test for MVP
3. Contains all core functionality (flow tracking, proportional distribution)
4. Can be upgraded to full Superfluid later if needed

### What Works

✅ Pool flow rate configuration
✅ Proportional reward distribution
✅ Flow rate calculations
✅ Real-time streaming display in frontend
✅ Active delegate tracking
✅ Reward estimates

### Future Improvements

1. Deploy full RewardDistributor with Superfluid integration
2. Add actual token streaming (currently tracking only)
3. Implement claim functionality
4. Add reward history tracking
5. Connect VotePowerVerifier.setRewardDistributor()

## Scripts

### Configure Rewards
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/configure-rewards.ts --network chiado
```

### Verify Deployment
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-rewards.ts --network chiado
```
