# dCider Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First Architecture

Every feature MUST be developed as a standalone library before integration.

**Rules:**
- Libraries must be self-contained with clear, documented interfaces
- Each library must be independently testable without external dependencies
- Smart contracts are libraries and must follow modular design patterns
- Frontend components must be decoupled from blockchain-specific logic where possible
- Clear separation between business logic (libraries) and integration layers (dApp UI, contract deployment)

**Rationale:** Modular architecture enables independent testing, reusability across different frontends or chains, and easier auditing of smart contract logic. In blockchain development, this separation is critical for security and upgradeability.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD is mandatory for all development: tests written → user approved → tests fail → then implement.

**Rules:**
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced for all code
- Smart contracts MUST have comprehensive test coverage before deployment
- Frontend components MUST have acceptance tests matching user stories
- Integration tests MUST verify blockchain interactions before testnet deployment
- No code ships without passing tests

**Rationale:** In blockchain development, bugs are expensive and often irreversible. Test-first development catches issues before deployment, ensures contract logic matches specifications, and provides confidence in upgrades. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE due to the immutable nature of deployed smart contracts.

### III. Simplicity & YAGNI

Start simple. Complexity must be explicitly justified. You Aren't Gonna Need It.

**Rules:**
- Default to the simplest solution that meets current requirements
- Avoid premature abstraction and over-engineering
- Each layer of complexity requires documented justification in plan.md
- Prefer proven patterns over novel approaches unless novel approach solves specific problem
- Smart contract bytecode size and gas optimization secondary to clarity and correctness

**Rationale:** Blockchain systems are inherently complex. Unnecessary architectural complexity increases attack surface, audit costs, and maintenance burden. Simple, clear code is easier to audit, reason about, and prove correct.

### IV. Smart Contract Security

Security is paramount. All contract code undergoes rigorous validation before deployment.

**Rules:**
- Follow established security patterns (checks-effects-interactions, reentrancy guards, etc.)
- All state changes must be properly validated and access-controlled
- External calls must be treated as potentially malicious
- Gas limits and economic attacks must be considered in design
- Contract upgrades require migration plans and backward compatibility analysis
- Test suite MUST include security-focused test cases (reentrancy, overflow, access control)

**Rationale:** Smart contract vulnerabilities lead to permanent, irreversible loss of user funds and trust. Security cannot be retrofitted; it must be designed in from the start through test-driven security validation.

### V. Observability & Transparency

All components must be debuggable, auditable, and transparent.

**Rules:**
- Smart contracts MUST emit events for all state changes
- Frontend MUST log all blockchain interactions (transactions, queries, errors)
- Structured logging required for all backend services
- Contract source code and verification on block explorers
- Clear error messages for users when transactions fail
- Testnet deployments must be publicly verifiable

**Rationale:** Blockchain applications operate in trustless environments. Observability through events and logs enables debugging, auditing, and user trust. Transparency is a core blockchain value and must extend to all layers of the application.

## Blockchain-Specific Requirements

### Smart Contract Standards

- Solidity version MUST be explicitly pinned (e.g., `pragma solidity 0.8.19;`)
- Follow OpenZeppelin security patterns and libraries where applicable
- All contracts MUST compile without warnings at high optimization levels
- Contract size MUST stay under deployment limits (24KB for Ethereum)
- Gas optimization only after correctness and security are proven

### Frontend Integration

- Web3 wallet integration via standard providers (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Graceful handling of network switches, wallet disconnections, and transaction failures
- Transaction status tracking with clear user feedback
- Support for transaction signing and verification workflows
- Read-only mode for users without connected wallets where applicable

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all contract functions and modifiers
- Integration tests against local blockchain (Hardhat, Ganache, Anvil)
- Fork tests against mainnet state when relevant
- Frontend tests with mocked blockchain interactions
- End-to-end tests on testnet before mainnet deployment

## Development Workflow

### Test-Driven Implementation Flow

1. **Specification:** User stories defined with acceptance criteria in spec.md
2. **Test Design:** Write failing tests that validate acceptance criteria
3. **User Approval:** Review test cases with stakeholders before implementation
4. **Implementation:** Write minimal code to make tests pass (Red-Green-Refactor)
5. **Validation:** All tests pass, code meets simplicity and security principles
6. **Testnet Deploy:** Smart contracts deployed to testnet for integration testing
7. **Audit:** Security review before mainnet deployment (for production features)

### Code Review Requirements

- All PRs reviewed for principle compliance
- Smart contract PRs require security-focused review
- Test coverage must be maintained or improved
- Complexity additions require explicit justification in PR description
- Frontend PRs verify blockchain interaction patterns

## Governance

### Amendment Process

Constitution changes follow lightweight governance:

- Proposed changes documented in a pull request
- Team discussion and consensus-based approval
- Migration plan required if changes affect existing features
- Version updated according to semantic versioning rules

### Version Policy

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes to core principles or removal of principles
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New principles added or significant expansions to existing principles
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance

- Constitution principles guide all development but do not block progress
- Violations flagged in code review for discussion
- Repeated violations trigger constitution review for practicality
- Complexity justifications tracked in plan.md Complexity Tracking section

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-18 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-18
